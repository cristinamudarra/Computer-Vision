# Computer-Vision
This is a compilation of the projects that I have been developing for the computer vision course offered by KU Leuven university
[Assignment 1]
  The goal of this individual assignment is to apply some basic image processing techniques
  to detect an object and produce a one minute video for submission:
  - Processing of videos
  - Smoothing & blurring with Gaussian or Bilateral filter
  - Thresholding in BGR & HSV Color Space + binary morphological operations
  - Edge detection with Sobel technique
  - Circle detection with Hough transform
  - Map intensity values proportional to the likelihood of the object of interest being at
    that location
  - Tracking of an object
  - Change the color of an object & check the robustness of the method by rotating the image
  - Face detection - Cascade
